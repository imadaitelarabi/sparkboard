# Focus Mode Feature Design Document

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
Focus Mode provides a unified task dashboard where users can aggregate tasks from multiple projects into a focused kanban view with To Do, In Progress, and Done columns. Tasks can be added via drag-and-drop, and status changes sync bidirectionally with their original projects.

## ðŸ“Š Data Architecture

### Core Data Structures

#### FocusTask
```typescript
interface FocusTask {
  id: string          // Task ID from database
  addedAt: number     // Timestamp when added to focus mode
  position?: number   // Optional position within focus mode
}
```

#### FocusMode
```typescript
interface FocusMode {
  tasks: FocusTask[]           // Array of focused task references
  settings: TimeframeSettings  // User-defined reset settings  
  lastResetAt: number          // Timestamp of last reset
  isActive: boolean           // Whether focus mode is currently active
  createdAt: number           // When focus mode was first created
}
```

#### TimeframeSettings
```typescript
interface TimeframeSettings {
  type: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'custom'
  customDays?: number      // For custom timeframe
  resetTime: number        // Hour of day to reset (0-23)
  autoReset: boolean      // Whether to auto-reset expired tasks
}
```

### State Management Integration

#### Zustand Store Extensions
Add to existing AppState:
```typescript
// Focus Mode state
focusMode: FocusMode | null
setFocusMode: (focusMode: FocusMode | null) => void
toggleFocusMode: () => void
addTasksToFocus: (taskIds: string[]) => void
removeTaskFromFocus: (taskId: string) => void
updateFocusSettings: (settings: Partial<TimeframeSettings>) => void

// UI state for focus mode
isFocusModeActive: boolean
setIsFocusModeActive: (active: boolean) => void
pendingFocusTasks: string[]  // Tasks being dragged to focus mode
setPendingFocusTasks: (tasks: string[]) => void
showFocusFloatingCard: boolean
setShowFocusFloatingCard: (show: boolean) => void
```

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Design

### Dashboard Integration

#### 1. Focus Mode Toggle
**Location**: Dashboard header, next to view mode toggle
**Design**: Toggle switch with "Focus Mode" label
**States**: 
- Off: Normal kanban/grid view
- On: Focus mode kanban view

#### 2. Empty Focus Mode State
**Trigger**: Focus mode active but no tasks added
**Design**: Center card with:
- "Focus Mode is Empty" title
- "Add tasks to get focused" subtitle  
- "Add Tasks" button
**Action**: Button triggers add task flow

#### 3. Add Tasks Flow
**Trigger**: "Add Tasks" button or drag-and-drop
**Design**: 
- Shows normal kanban grouped by project
- Floating focus card at bottom
- Tasks can be dragged to floating card
**Visual feedback**: 
- Task counter in floating card increases
- Floating card grows/highlights on hover
- "Confirm Adding Tasks" button appears when tasks pending

#### 4. Focus Mode Kanban
**Design**: Standard kanban with 3 columns:
- **To Do**: `status = 'pending'`
- **In Progress**: `status = 'in_progress'`  
- **Done**: `status = 'completed'`
**Features**:
- Drag & drop between columns
- Task cards show project context
- Remove from focus action per task
- Add new task directly to focus mode

### Component Architecture

#### FocusModeToggle
- Toggle switch component
- Integrates with dashboard header
- Manages focus mode activation state

#### FocusModeEmpty  
- Empty state component
- Call-to-action for adding tasks
- Triggers add task flow

#### FocusFloatingCard
- Floating bottom card for drag targets
- Shows pending task count
- Confirm/cancel actions for batch adding

#### FocusModeKanban
- Specialized kanban for focus mode
- Fixed 3-column layout (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Task cards with project context and remove actions

#### FocusModeSettings
- Modal/panel for timeframe configuration
- Reset time selection
- Auto-reset toggle
- Custom timeframe input

## âš¡ User Flows

### Primary Flow: Adding Tasks to Focus Mode
1. User clicks "Toggle Focus Mode" â†’ Focus mode activates
2. If empty: User sees empty state â†’ clicks "Add Tasks"
3. System shows project-grouped kanban with floating card
4. User drags tasks to floating card â†’ counter increases
5. User clicks "Confirm Adding Tasks" â†’ focus mode kanban appears
6. User can now work with focused tasks in 3-column view

### Secondary Flows

#### Working with Focus Mode Tasks
1. User drags tasks between To Do/In Progress/Done
2. System syncs status change with original project
3. Task maintains project context in card display

#### Removing Tasks from Focus
1. User clicks remove icon on task card
2. Task disappears from focus mode
3. Original task status unchanged in project

#### Creating New Focus Tasks
1. User clicks "+" in focus mode column
2. Modal opens for task creation
3. User selects project and fills details
4. Task created in project AND added to focus mode

#### Timeframe Management
1. User accesses focus mode settings
2. Configures reset timeframe (daily/weekly/monthly/custom)
3. Sets reset time and auto-reset preference
4. System automatically resets focus mode based on settings

## ðŸ”„ Data Synchronization

### Task Status Sync
- Focus mode changes update original task status
- Original project changes reflect in focus mode
- Bidirectional sync ensures consistency

### Focus Mode Persistence
- Tasks stored as references (IDs) in localStorage
- Full task data fetched from database on load
- Automatic cleanup of non-existent task references

### Auto-Reset Logic
- Checks timeframe settings on focus mode load
- Automatically clears expired tasks
- Preserves user settings across resets

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation
1. âœ… Focus mode localStorage utility
2. ðŸ”„ Zustand store integration
3. ðŸ”„ Basic UI components (toggle, empty state)

### Phase 2: Drag & Drop Experience
1. Floating card component
2. Drag target integration
3. Add tasks flow with visual feedback

### Phase 3: Focus Mode Kanban
1. Specialized kanban component
2. Task status synchronization
3. Remove tasks functionality

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Create tasks directly in focus mode
2. Timeframe settings and auto-reset
3. Focus mode statistics and insights

### Phase 5: Polish & Testing
1. Animations and micro-interactions
2. Error handling and edge cases
3. Performance optimization
4. End-to-end testing
